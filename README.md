# DeepMirror Task (ML Engineer)

## Requirements
* Train a supervised graph neural network, a tree model and a transformer model
* Choose a dataset(s) from the TDC to train the models with
* Benchmark the performance of the models and choose an appropriate metric to compare them
* Summarise your findings in a format that can be clearly understood by the sales team

## Task and Thought Process

### Stage 1: Dataset and learning about stuff
* Initially the very first thing I did was to take a look at the dataset, and I realised I have to get familiar with the terms and understand the data, so that I know what I am doing at all times.  
* So I went ahead and studied about ADME properties, Drug discovery, SMILES, molecular property prediction and understood how ADME works, this took me about an hour to catch on to terms.  
* At this stage I chose the HIA dataset since in my opinion the most common type of drug absorption is through the intestine, and the drug is taken orally most of the time, such as syrups, tablets etc.

### Stage 2: Training and tree model - Decision Trees
* Since this was the easiest of all 3 models, and since I already have knowledge about decision trees (link to my blog: https://medium.com/@beekiran00/tree-algorithms-decision-trees-1c18d9fe429c), it took me about 15b mins to prepare a model and train and test it.
* The code can be found in the repository at *Decision Tree Classifier.ipynb*
